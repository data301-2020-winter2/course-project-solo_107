## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This data set is provided by kaggle.com, which is an online community of data scientists where there are public datasets. My data set, Wine Reviews, was created in 2017 by a full-stack engineer on Kaggle.com who scraped wine reviews from WineEnthusiast, which is a wine magazine. The magazine contains a directory of wine reviews in which the reviewer gives the wine a score based on its quality and flavour. This data set contains the country, the region, province, the points (measuring quality), the price, and the name of the wine reviewer for 130k wine reviews. The creator of the data set put this data together for the purpose of fun and learning. The creator was inspired by a documentary about master sommeliers and wondered whether it would be possible to teach a computer to recognize wine by its flavour description or to guess the price of wine based on its quality score.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

From analyzing this data set, I hope to learn about how the quality and location of wine are related to its price. I am interested in this data set because I have watched a documentary about wine tasting and I have gone wine tasting at some wineries. However, I never understood what qualities can make one wine so much more expensive than another. Additionally, I think it will be interesting to see which regions have the highest quality wine and which have the most expensive wine. Perhaps my analysis will be useful for determining the best places to go on vineyards tours while on vacation and which wines can be bought for the best quality at the most reasonable price. There are three questions I would like to explore: How is the price of wine related to its quality score? What country produces the highest scoring wine? What are the top ten most expensive regions for producing wine? I think that I will be able to build a nice dashboard based on some of the questions that I have about the data because I think this data will be good for visualizing.
